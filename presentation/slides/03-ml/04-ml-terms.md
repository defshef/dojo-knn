## Classification

### We're solving a classification problem
> is this iris versicolor, setosa or virginica?

### There are other kinds...
- regression, like predicting a numeric house price
- unsupervised, when we don't know the answers

note:
the iris problem is:
- classification (what species is this one?)
- supervised (we have a dataset with correct answers in it)
