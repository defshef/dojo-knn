## Training and Testing

### Training
- training examples are fed to the ML algorithm
- a model is built that can predict for new examples

### Testing
- the model predicts for examples it hasn't seen before
- "goodness" of the model is assessed

note:
- goodness is a more complex problem than you'd think
