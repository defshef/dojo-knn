## Train/Test Split

- assign some examples to a "training" set (say 70%)
- and the rest to a "test" set (say 30%)
- have the algorithm memorize the training set
- predict the classes of the test set
- how many did it get right? (%)

note:
 - simple approach
 - you need to assign examples to the train/test sets randomly!
